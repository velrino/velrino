Full Stack Software Engineer with a lot of coding experience. Throughout my career I've been architecturing, scaling up and engineering projects from scratch, beside managing development teams and scrum agile procedures, aiming to use well-architectured solutions, continuous integration, security and high team performance.

I worked with PHP and Java since the beginning of my career. Eventually, A little over 5 years ago I have migrate to JavaScript/TypeScript. I've used used and experienced lots os frameworks and successed in all of them, to share some in JavaScript: React JS, Angular, React Native, Node.js Express, Nest.js, among others and I started working with TypeScript too.

I also have been coding with Flutter, Python and Golang in several moments when the team decided to use those languages and frameworks.

I've integrated the applications I designed and developed with some other services and API's which were very helpfull to successed the efiency, usability and experience of the app, such as: Digital payments and bankings, Redis (Pub/Sub), RabbitMQ, SQS, SNS, Cloudinary, S3, ElasticSearch, Firebase, Google My Business Reviews, OCR Image Detectors, Twilio (SMS and WhatsApp), SES, SendGrid, SendinBlue, to metion some of them.

To scale and garantee the application integration, I worked with Heroku, AWS, GCP, NewRelic and DataDog.

I'm very proud that several projects that I helped to create from the scratch have been growing up and selling so fast, making those start ups earn big clients around the world.

For all these I've just said, I believe I have much more to accomplish because I've always been focused, determined, open-minded, electrifying passionate man.

You can count on me. Let's keep in touch and change the world for better!
